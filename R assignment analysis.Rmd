## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
ggplot(payment_methods, aes(x = "", y = count, fill = payment_method)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  labs(title = "Payment Method Distribution", x = "", y = "") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(sales_by_customer, aes(x = reorder(customer_name, total_sales), y = total_sales)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "coral") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Customers by Sales", x = "Customer Name", y = "Total Sales") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
